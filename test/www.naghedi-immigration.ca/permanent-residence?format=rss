If the Minister believes there are compassionate reasons to do so, they can grant the individual permanent residency or exempt them from certain rules. This decision is made based on what's best for the individual, especially if there are children involved.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Factors that may influence the decision include, but are not restricted to:</p><h4><strong>1- Establishment in Canada:</strong></h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Evidence of your integration into Canadian society.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Circumstances that prevent you from leaving Canada, contributing to your establishment.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>2- Hardship </strong>(applies to applicants in Canada and overseas):</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Ties to Canada that would be disrupted if you were required to leave.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Health concerns or family violence that may pose challenges if you were to return to your home country.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Consequences of being separated from family members who are in Canada.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Underlying circumstances and potential hardships if the applicant is returned to their country of origin.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class="sqsrte-large"></p><p class="sqsrte-large">As of December 10, 2015, there isn't a specific 'hardship test' for applicants under H&amp;C.

          <p class="">The short answer is no! The Canadian Experience Class doesn't have a specific education requirement. However, you can — and it’s also recommended — improve your ranking in the Express Entry pool by providing proof of your education. This entails providing evidence of completing your education and possessing credentials from a Canadian institution, and if your education was obtained outside of Canada, you'll also need to provide an Educational Credential Assessment to show equivalence to a completed education at the same level. </p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p>

          <p class="">The short answer is no! The Federal Skilled Trades Program doesn't have a mandatory education requirement. However, you can — and it’s also recommended — improve your ranking in the Express Entry pool by providing proof of your education. This entails providing evidence of completing your education and possessing credentials from a Canadian institution, and if your education was obtained outside of Canada, you'll also need to provide an Educational Credential Assessment to show equivalence to a completed education at the same level. </p>

  <p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="sqsrte-large">Canada invites accomplished business professionals who are in search of new opportunities and challenges. The Business Immigration Program is crafted to promote and simplify the entry of these individuals. Both the federal and provincial/territorial governments extend a warm welcome to business immigrants, providing services to assist them in initiating businesses and establishing a life in Canada.</p><p class=""><br></p><h4><span class="sqsrte-text-color--accent"><strong>Start-Up Visa Program - SUV</strong></span></h4><p class="sqsrte-large"><br>The Canada Start-up Visa Program is designed for entrepreneurs who possess innovative abilities, can generate employment opportunities for Canadians, and are capable of competing on a global scale. Its objective is to attract individuals who can make significant contributions to the Canadian economy by establishing and expanding businesses across the country, excluding Quebec. This initiative aligns with Canada's objectives of promoting innovation, fostering local job creation, and bolstering international competitiveness. Under this program, a maximum of five applicants can be considered for the same business venture.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class="sqsrte-large"></p><p class="sqsrte-large">To qualify as a member of the start-up business class, you need to fulfill the following conditions:</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class="sqsrte-large"></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">You should have obtained a Letter of Support which is a support and commitment from one or more designated entities.

This permit is solely for entrepreneurs aiming to develop their business in Canada and is exclusive to the Start-up Visa Program. It is valid for one year.<br></p><p class="sqsrte-large">When applying for a work permit, you can potentially bring your spouse or common-law partner along with your dependent children. However, you must be able to financially support them and they all need to meet the requirements for temporary residence. Family members joining you can apply for an open work permit if eligible, and dependent children accompanying you can apply for a study permit. It is important to note that each family member needs to complete a separate application for a visitor visa, work permit, or study permit. <br></p><p class="sqsrte-large">You can submit all family applications alongside your work permit application.</p><p class=""><br></p></li></ul>
