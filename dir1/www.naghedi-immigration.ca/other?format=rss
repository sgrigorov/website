Per IRCC, the following could be examples of proof:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Results from third party language test we approve</p></li><li><p class="">Diploma, certificate or final transcript for a secondary or post-secondary school program in English or French</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Results from a government-funded language training program with at least a CLB/NCLC level</p></li></ul><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class=""> If you can't meet a requirement, you can request a <strong>waiver</strong>, which, if approved, means you're exempt from that particular requirement, but it's important to note that you must first be found qualified for it.

  <h4><strong> PR Travel Document (PRTD)</strong></h4><p class="sqsrte-large">A PR (Permanent Resident) Travel Document is an official document issued to permanent residents of Canada who are outside the country and need to return. It allows them to travel back to Canada while maintaining their status as permanent residents. This document is essential for individuals who do not have a valid PR card or whose PR card is expired. The PR Travel Document confirms their permanent resident status and is necessary for re-entry into Canada.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">A permanent resident outside Canada can get a travel document after a check if the officer decides that they meet or have already met the residency obligations, or if they were in Canada at least once in the last 365 days and have an ongoing appeal that's not finished yet.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p>

If you are determined to be inadmissible, you will be denied a visa or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), and you may also be refused entry to Canada or, if you are already in Canada, you may be removed. There are number of reasons  for which you might be deemed inadmissible, such as:</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><br></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Security grounds, including espionage and terrorism.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Human or international rights violations, such as  being subject to international sanctions or involved in war crimes and crimes against humanity. </p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Criminality and Serious Criminality, including theft, assault, and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. </p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Organized Criminality, including money laundering or people smuggling.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Health reasons, such as health and safety concerns or causing an excessive demand on health or social services in Canada.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Financial reasons., including lack of means to support oneself and family members in Canada. </p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Misrepresentation, including providing false or misleading information or withholding important information directly related to the  matter and the decision being made. </p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Failure to comply with the law, including failure to meet permanent residency obligations.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Having an inadmissible family member.</p></li></ul><p class="sqsrte-large"><br></p><p class="sqsrte-large">For certain grounds of inadmissibility, there might be remedies such as appealing the decision, applying for a temporary  permit, or seeking rehabilitation. However, in some cases, there is no remedy, and the person could be issued a removal order, forcing them to leave Canada, and f they are outside of Canada, re-entry into the country can be prohibited. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">Generally, if you are outside Canada and deemed inadmissible, entry into Canada will be denied. However, in exceptional circumstances where you have a valid reason to travel, a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) may be issued.</p><p class=""><br></p>
