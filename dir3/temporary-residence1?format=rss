  <p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h4><strong>Temporary Resident Visa (TRV)</strong></h4><p class="sqsrte-large"><br>A Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) is an official document issued by a visa office and placed inside a person's passport, confirming their eligibility for temporary entry into Canada.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">It's important to note that having a TRV doesn't automatically guarantee you entry into Canada. The permission to enter and temporarily reside in Canada is a privilege granted based on meeting specific requirements and depends on the officer’s decision and examination at the Port of Entry, upon your arrival. <br></p><p class="sqsrte-large">The purpose of your travel to Canada determines the documents you will need to submit for your visa submission, and this may include visiting as a tourist, for business, to join a spouse or partner who has sponsored you for permanent residence, for a family visit, for compassionate reasons, or other valid reasons.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">To apply for a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) for Canada, ensure you have all necessary documents, including a statement outlining the purpose of your visit and any country-specific requirements, along with the application package.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Additionally, you should:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Hold a valid passport or other appropriate travel documents.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Be in good health.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Provide evidence of a clean criminal record that does not pose a threat to Canada's safety, if required. </p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Express your intention to leave Canada before your authorized stay expires.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Demonstrate sufficient financial means to support yourself and your family during your visit, including funds for round-trip transportation.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Confirm that you do not intend to study or work in Canada.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Provide adequate documentation for any accompanying minor children, if applicable.</p></li></ul>

  <p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h4><strong>Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA)</strong></h4><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class="sqsrte-large"></p><p class="sqsrte-large">An Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) is a  requirement for most visa-exempt foreigners visiting Canada by air. Notably, this requirement doesn't apply when arriving by car, bus, train, or boat (including cruise ships). The eTA will digitally be linked to the traveler’s passport and remains valid for up to five years or until the passport expires, whichever comes first. You are required to renew your eTA upon obtaining a new passport.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Possessing a valid eTA allows for multiple short stays in Canada via air travel, typically up to six months per visit. However, having an eTA doesn't automatically guarantee entry into Canada. Upon arrival, a border services officer will request your passport and other relevant documents. You must effectively demonstrate to the officer that you meet the criteria for entry into Canada.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">You should also be admissible to Canada and provide adequate documents, when required, indicative of:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">The purpose of your trip</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Your intention to leave Canada before the expiry of your authorized stay</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Your ties to your country of residence</p></li></ul><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>  </strong></p><h4><strong> To apply for an eTA, you will need to have:</strong></h4><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">A valid passport issued by a visa-exempt country. </p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">An active and valid email address.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">A form of payment to cover the non-refundable fee, such as a valid credit card.</p></li></ol><p class="sqsrte-large"><br>Since April 26, 2022, lawful permanent residents of the United States are no longer required to obtain an eTA. However, they should review the necessary documents and meet the other requirements as a temporary resident for travel to Canada.</p><p class=""><br><br></p>

  <h4><strong>Super Visa</strong></h4><p class="sqsrte-large">The Super Visa is a special  type of visa that allows multiple entries into Canada and can be valid for up to 10 years. However, each time someone enters, they're allowed to stay for a maximum of 5 years. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">Super Visa is suggested as an alternative for parents and grandparents whose PGP sponsorship has been refused or not processed yet. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">To qualify for a Super Visa, you must submit your application from outside Canada, be admissible , and provide additional relevant supporting documents as evidence that you meet the criteria, including the following:</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class="sqsrte-large"></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">A valid passport.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Evidence of an eligible host who is your child or grandchild, along with an invitation letter from them.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Documentation of medical fitness/admissibility.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Documentation of valid health insurance coverage.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Evidence of meeting the conditions for temporary residence as a visitor in Canada, including ties to your home country, the purpose of your trip, and other relevant factors.</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><br></p></li></ul>
